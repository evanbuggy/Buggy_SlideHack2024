# The Green Escape

This Super Mario 64 ROM Hack was made for Simpleflips' Slide Hack Competition of 2024. Play as Luigi in his eternal struggle to outshine his own brother, as you collect as many coins as you can in a green utopia!

Built using HackerSM64, level models and hud elements made by me, file select theme made by Torodicus, 2 painting textures made by Gingeriyo. Special thanks to Frijoles.z64 for playtesting on console.

You can download and play it for yourself [here](https://romhacking.com/hack/the-green-escape).

Use the command `make -j$(nproc)` to build. For further instructions, see the [HackerSM64 wiki](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64/wiki).

**The provided directories `build/us_n64/actors/hud_face` and `build/us_n64/actors/hud_face_2` do not contain any built files from vanilla SM64. They contain the files for the HUD icons of Luigi's face.**
